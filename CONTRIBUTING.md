This project consists of an eXpress server written in Node, a Node script, and an Apps Script written in a Node like language. The App Script can be
called from the eXpress Server, the command line, a batch job, or directly from the App Script UI. Code for the eXpress Server and Node script are in the client directory and code for the App Script are in the googlescript directory.

The google script directory includes a separate [CONTRIBUTING.md in googleScript directory](googleScript/CONTRIBUTING.md). See [RESOURCES.md](./RESOURCES.md) for additional information.
