### Overview

As developers, we want a Google Apps Script to convert the current guides in Google Docs to markdown files, so that the markdown files can be used to display the guides on our website.

#### List of Features Required for the MD Converter

The following are features of what we need the MD Converter to do:

- Find the file (guide) within the folder or drive.
  o File can be found by reference or name if it exists.
- Reads the contents of the file, including:
  o Headings
  o Bulleted lists
  o Numbered lists
  o Multileveled lists
  o Indentations and Spaces
  o Font styles (bold, italics, underline)
  o URLS
  o Images
  o Text blocks, or areas of code nested inside of the document.
- Formats the contents of the file accordingly.
- Returns image paths where images were specifically inserted in the document.
- Creates a folder as an output with the following contents:
  o File as a Markdown, generated by name. (Example: “how-to-set-reminders-in-slack.md”)
  o Creates a folder to save images that were inserted within the Google Doc.

### Action Item

Continue building Hack for LA's customizable Markdown Converter using Apps Script, including features that would make the conversion from Docs to MD feasible.

- [ ] Research and identify additional Google Docs to Markdown converters that could be used
- [ ] Research and identify if there are any open-source code that we can use in our own Markdown converter code by crediting them. This will require you to check their open-source code license and decide if they allow it.
- [ ] From your research, do a competitive and comparative analysis and fill out the [HfLA-Website: Google Docs to Markdown Converter Competitive or Comparative Analysis spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uimYvukyRSxF_5iK9JPZWd2FwdKufjt6Ohlve_bax0o/edit#gid=1259306930)

Alyssa built the Apps Script as seen in this [link](https://script.google.com/home/projects/1CFED97nWJO_zVzDvrN6wUztJVZQaDFUhrSKe3BXaaHhV02X5AgqT4mRR/edit). Alyssa is moving off the project and @ethanstrominger is now working on it.

For testing purposes, "How to Set Reminders in Slack" was used in development of that script.

Next steps for Ethan:

- [x] Review work done by Alyssa documented in this issue
- [x] Investigate existing open source (see findings below)
- [ ] Check with Alyssa if any additional resources created and anything checked into GitHub
- [ ] Find out where to store collateral:
  - [ ] Is separate repository an option?
  - [ ] If existing repository, where does the collateral get stored
- [ ] Find out if converting to HTML is acceptable. There is an open source project that already does this (see Findings) that does a great job.
- [ ] Identify where to store sample Google Docs used for testing.
- [ ] Create sample Google docs with one or two features to be tested and one document with all the features.
- [x] Investigate how to import and export from Google Apps Script. The scripts have to be written and run in Google Apps Script. Import/export is needed to be able to check in to github.
- [ ] Document process for importing and exporting from Google Apps Script and doing source control.
- [x] Investigate existing markdown to Google Docs apps. This will help in creating scripts.
- [ ] Create automated test using "Gold Data" created when a conversion for a Google doc is deemed successful. Gold data will consist of google docs to be converted and HTML or markdown equivalent.
- [x] Create initial script either based on Alyssa's script or an open source project for converting a single document to markdown.
- [x] Modify script to convert all documents in a specified directory

Work left to be done on the script (note: may use an existing open source project - see findings below.

- [ ] Create a method that will search and return all bulleted and numbered lists in MD syntax.
- [ ] Update the following variable `var file = findFileByName("How to Set Reminders in Slack");` in Main.gs so that it acts as an add-on for any open documents rather than the name of the file.
  - The current method only searches for the file name. We want to use this script as an add-on so we can apply it to any guide.
  - For extra references, ask for permission from one of the HfLA Website Team's technical leads or merge team members to access the Apps Script for _Wins to Review_ folder.
- [ ] Create a method that replaces every double quote with backticks in the markdown, e.g. Enter "/Remind" into the field, into copy and paste text, e.g., Enter `/Remind` into the field. More information [here](https://github.com/hackforla/guides/issues/10#issuecomment-936572293).
- [ ] Create a method that would automatically set the full image path for images in generated image folder.
  - The current method returns `![image alt text](/image-1.png)`
  - Expected output: `![[image alt text](../assets/images/guides/how-to-set-reminders-in-slack/image2.png "image_tooltip")`
- [ ] Create a method that will automatically generate the front matter as seen below:

- [ ] If any updates in the script are needed to make the converter more feasible, please feel free to edit.
- [ ] All outputs **must** match the original Google Docs.
- [ ] **If there is another option (such as a different Docs to MD extension) that (at the very least) returns the same output in MD, please feel free to let us know as well. If the new option returns the same output in MD, then the next step is to fulfill the rest of the tasks list to complete the issue.**
